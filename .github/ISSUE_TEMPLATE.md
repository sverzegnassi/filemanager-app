## Issue Template

Before starting, please make sure your issue has not been [reported already]().

If that's the case, feel free to add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments) on that report.
We will know that it affects you and we'll try to give it an higher priority whenever possible.

You can use this template to raise two different types of issue. Choose the appropriate section and delete the other section.

  1. Bug report &mdash; issues or inconsistency within the application
  2. Feature request &mdash; raise a proposal for new features or design changes

Thank you for taking some time to report your experience :blush:
